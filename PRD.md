# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Cauliform - Voice-Powered Google Form Agent

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** March 5, 2026
**Hackathon Deadline:** March 16, 2026 @ 5:00pm PDT
**Category:** Live Agents

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Cauliform is an AI-powered voice agent that converts Google Forms into phone call experiences. Users paste a Google Form link, receive an automated call, and complete the form conversationally while hands-free.

**Target Hackathon Prize:** Best of Live Agents ($10,000) or Grand Prize ($25,000)

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Pain Point
- Google Forms require full visual attention and manual typing
- Users abandon forms when busy, commuting, or multitasking
- Accessibility barriers for users with visual/motor impairments
- No voice-first option exists within the Google ecosystem

### Market Opportunity
- Millions of Google Forms created daily
- Growing demand for voice interfaces (smart speakers, voice assistants)
- Accessibility compliance becoming mandatory for organizations

---

## 3. Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
1. Demonstrate real-time voice interaction using Gemini Live API
2. Successfully parse and submit Google Forms via phone call
3. Create a seamless, interruptible conversation experience

### Success Metrics (Demo Day)
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Form completion rate | 100% for demo forms |
| Average call duration | < 2 min for 5-question form |
| Voice recognition accuracy | > 95% |
| Interruption handling | Graceful mid-sentence stops |

---

## 4. User Personas

### Persona 1: Busy Professional (Primary)
- **Name:** Sarah, 32, Marketing Manager
- **Context:** Fills forms during commute, between meetings
- **Pain:** "I see a form notification but I'm driving—I'll do it later" (never does)
- **Goal:** Complete forms without stopping current activity

### Persona 2: Accessibility User
- **Name:** Marcus, 45, Software Engineer (low vision)
- **Context:** Screen readers work but are tedious for forms
- **Pain:** "Form layouts break my screen reader flow"
- **Goal:** Natural voice conversation instead of navigating UI

### Persona 3: Student
- **Name:** Alex, 20, College Student
- **Context:** Constant event registrations, course surveys
- **Pain:** "I have 5 forms to fill out and I'm walking to class"
- **Goal:** Batch complete forms while moving

## 7. Agent Pipeline

The Cauliform agent follows a structured pipeline that manages user identification, form traversal, response collection, and submission confirmation.

### 7.1 High-Level Pipeline Flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Input
        A[Form URL + Phone] --> B[Validate Input]
    end

    subgraph UserLookup["User Identification"]
        B --> C{Known User?}
        C -->|Yes| D[Load Profile]
        C -->|No| E[Create Profile]
        D --> F[Pre-fill Answers]
        E --> F
    end

    subgraph FormProcess["Form Processing"]
        F --> G[Parse Form]
        G --> H[Build Question Queue]
    end

    subgraph Call["Voice Call"]
        H --> I[Initiate Call]
        I --> J[Gemini Agent]
        J --> K[Question Loop]
        K --> L[Confirm Responses]
    end

    subgraph Submit["Submission"]
        L --> M[Submit Form]
        M --> N[Update Profile]
        N --> O[Send Email]
    end
```

### 7.2 User Profile System

Phone number serves as the primary user identifier. The system learns and remembers common responses across forms.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USER_PROFILE {
        string phoneNumber PK "E.164 format"
        string email
        string firstName
        string lastName
        json knownResponses "Auto-learned fields"
        int formsCompleted
        timestamp lastActiveAt
    }

    CALL_SESSION {
        string id PK
        string phoneNumber FK
        string formUrl
        string formTitle
        string status
        json responses
        timestamp startedAt
    }

    USER_PROFILE ||--o{ CALL_SESSION : initiates
```

**Known Response Fields (Auto-Learned):**
- `email` - Email address
- `fullName` - Full name
- `firstName` / `lastName` - Name parts
- `phone` - Phone number
- `company` - Organization name
- `jobTitle` - Position/role
- `address`, `city`, `state`, `zipCode`, `country` - Location info

### 7.3 Conversation State Machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle

    Idle --> LookupUser: Start Call
    LookupUser --> LoadProfile: User Found
    LookupUser --> CreateProfile: New User

    LoadProfile --> ParsingForm
    CreateProfile --> ParsingForm

    ParsingForm --> Calling: Questions Ready
    Calling --> Connected: User Answers
    Calling --> Failed: No Answer

    Connected --> Greeting
    Greeting --> AskQuestion

    AskQuestion --> Listening: Question Asked
    Listening --> Processing: Response Heard
    Processing --> AskQuestion: More Questions
    Processing --> Summarizing: All Done

    Summarizing --> Confirming: Summary Read
    Confirming --> Submitting: User Confirms
    Confirming --> AskQuestion: User Edits

    Submitting --> SendingEmail: Form Submitted
    SendingEmail --> Completed: Email Sent
    Completed --> [*]

    Failed --> [*]
```

### 7.4 Detailed Call Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant F as Frontend
    participant B as Backend
    participant DB as Firestore
    participant TW as Twilio
    participant G as Gemini Live
    participant GF as Google Forms
    participant E as Email

    U->>F: Enter Form URL + Phone
    F->>B: POST /api/start-call

    B->>DB: Lookup user by phone
    alt Existing User
        DB-->>B: User profile + known responses
    else New User
        B->>DB: Create new profile
    end

    B->>GF: Parse form questions
    GF-->>B: Questions[]

    B->>DB: Create call session
    B->>TW: Initiate call
    TW-->>U: Phone rings
    U->>TW: Answer

    TW->>B: Call connected
    B->>G: Start conversation

    G->>U: "Hi [Name]! I'll help you fill out [Form]..."

    loop Each Question
        G->>U: Ask question (use known answer if available)
        U->>G: Speak response
        G->>B: Store response
        B->>DB: Save to session
    end

    G->>U: "Let me confirm your answers..."
    U->>G: "Yes, submit"

    B->>GF: Submit form responses
    B->>DB: Update user profile with learned responses
    B->>E: Send confirmation email
    E-->>U: Email received

    G->>U: "Done! Check your email. Goodbye!"
    TW->>B: Call ended
```

### 7.5 Email Confirmation

After successful form submission, users receive an email containing:
- Form title
- All questions and their submitted answers
- Link to original form
- Timestamp of submission
